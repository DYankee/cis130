            <h2> Where I'm From</h2>
            <p>Where I'm from is actually a bit of a tricky question. I was born in Florida but only lived there for 4 years. From there I moved to Texas for a year. Then we moved to Maryland followed by a move to Pennsylvania for a while. Then we went back to Texas for the longest I've ever lived in one place. Just under 10 years. Then finally last year I moved to New York. So, while the technical answer is Florida because that's where I was born. Really, at this point, it's a mix of all of them. So I guess you could say I'm from the United States, Or from the internet. God knows I spend enough time there.
            </p>

            <h2>Hobbies / Interests</h2>
            <p>As you might be able to guess by my major. I enjoy working with and using computers. My first experience with computers was actually my mom's old Atari 2600. I remember trying to run games off floppy discs our grandfather gave us. Having to figure out how to get them to load with little or no documentation. The internet was still fairly undeveloped at that point so there wasn't much help there either. In my free time I enjoy gaming both on PC and consoles, but I prefer PC for the flexibility and freedom it offers. Some of my favorite games are: Dota 2, Iracing, and Minecraft; but those are just a few of dozens. Funnily enough Minecraft, specificity the mod <a href="https://tweaked.cc/">ComputerCraft</a> was one of the things that helped coding finally click for me. I also enjoy Playing/Writing music when I have time I play guitar, bass, and a little keyboard. I don't actually have much in the way of original work, but I enjoy covering songs as a way to practice playing and learn about composition.

            <h2>Knowledge / Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently enrolled at <a href="https://www.sunyocc.edu/">O.C.C</a>(Onondaga community collage) in the <a href="https://www.sunyocc.edu/programs/computer-information-systems-aas">CIS</a>(computer information systems) program. I have basic/Intermediate knowledge of html, css, and lua. I also know some basic JavaScript and python as well as. <br> Before starting at O.C.C I worked in the food service  industry for 5 years. 3 of which were in management positions. I currently work as a package handler at FedEx while I got to collage. I'm very detail oriented and can be a bit of a perfectionist but work well under time constraints.
