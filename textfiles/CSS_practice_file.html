<h1>My Favorite Movie - Galaxy Quest</h1>

<p>The first time I watched the movie, <span>Galaxy Quest</span>, I thought it was just another funny movie about humans versus aliens .  When I watched it again, I saw the humor of this movie that was a take-off on some of my other favorites - <span>Space Balls</span>,  <span>Star Wars</span> and a lot of the earlier <span>Star Trek</span> shows.</p>


<p>The plot centers around a TV show that had been canceled 18 years prior to this time and the actors had all gone their own ways.  But the show had a cult following.  There was a particular group of teenagers who believed the show and characters were real. There was a sci-fi convention where the actors were reuniting and appearing as their characters from the show.  Unfortunately all the old jealousies and grudges left over from the show resurfaced.  Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) had been self-centered and arrogant when the show was popular, and still had an attitude.  A lot of the resentments from the rest of the cast stemmed from his attitude.</p>

<p>What happened as they were together again all changed when some real aliens, the Thermians, came to ask for the group's help against General Sarris and his armada who were threatening to kill the Thermians.  The Thermians had watched this show from outer space and believed that it was all true.  So they came to Earth to get help.</p>
